This was a weekend project. I most likely won't introduce new features
unless they are explicitly requested and provided I have some spare time
and motivation. I will try though to fix any bugs as soon as feasible. 

Feel free to submit [issues](https://github.com/rejsmont/autodiscover.xml/issues),
including feature requests and to [contribute your code](https://github.com/rejsmont/autodiscover.xml/pulls).
